📦 Route Pool

AI-powered shared delivery platform helping SMEs reduce costs and carbon emissions through smart route pooling.

Route Pool is a logistics web application that matches small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with nearby deliveries to reduce transportation costs and environmental impact.
